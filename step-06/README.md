# froggit step 06

# Now we need to keep score, adding when hit, subtracting when we miss
  
1. Let's create a variable called score. We will initially set it to 1 
```
score = 0
```
2. Everytime we hit the frog, increment score. In frog_hit add :
```
 score += 1
```
3. Everytime the frog goes off the screen, decrement the score. 
```
score -= 1
```
4.
