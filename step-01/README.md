# froggit step 01

# This step will just get the initial window showing


1. Within the froggit folder, create a folder called step-01
2. Start Python IDLE
3. Start a Windows Command Line session - position IDLE and Command next to each other
4. Within the command line session, navigate to the step-01 folder (cd  _HOME_ froggit/step-01)
5. Create a new empty file called main.py (File -> New File )
6. Save as main.py
7. Check that a new window is generated by running  "pgzrun main.py"
8. Let's set the screen size:  
    WIDTH = 640  
    HEIGHT = 320  
9. Test that the window is of the required size
10. We now need to draw something, we create a **draw** function. Which pgzero will call whenever it needs to repaint the screen.  
def draw():
    screen.fill((0,230,255))

    This passes the RGB value to the screen object's fill method, This sets the colour to a light blue.
